# @cohorly/node

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Feature flags: remote evaluation on every SDK (`isFeatureEnabled`, `getFeatureFlag`, `getFeatureFlagPayload`, `getAllFlags`, `reloadFeatureFlags`, `onFeatureFlags`), identity-scoped persisted flag cache on client SDKs (reloaded on init/identify/reset), local evaluation for server SDKs (`@cohorly/node` and `@cohorly/nest` via a flag secret and polled definitions, ADR-0011), and `$feature_flag_called` exposure events (deduped per identity session on client SDKs via `sendExposureEvents`, per-call opt-in on server SDKs).

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 9d06dd2: Server behavior change: the destructive `/engage` verbs `$unset` and `$delete`
  (`people.unset` / `people.delete` / `people.delete_user` / `deleteUser`) are no
  longer honored when a request is authenticated only by the project token, which
  ships in public client bundles. They now require an org-owner or superadmin
  `Authorization: Bearer` credential on the same request. Refused ops are skipped
  individually - the rest of the batch still applies - and the server keeps
  answering HTTP 200 with `{ status: 0, error, applied, refused: [{ index, op }] }`,
  so SDK retry queues are not wedged. From these SDKs (which send only the project
  token) the destructive calls become server-side no-ops; remove profile data from
  the dashboard or via `DELETE /api/privacy/subjects/:distinctId` (audited).
  `set` / `set_once` / `increment` ($add) are unaffected. No SDK code changed;
  docs and type annotations updated.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- a5ba8cc: Fix `$lib_version` reporting: the `src/version.ts` constants had drifted from
  package.json (stuck at 0.1.0) because releases only bumped package.json. The
  constants are now corrected and kept in sync automatically at release time.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 219627e: Reposition the SDKs as hosted SaaS instead of a local self-hosted project, and
  make the ingestion host zero-config.

  - Descriptions, README intros, and examples now describe Cohorly as hosted
    product analytics.
  - `apiHost` is now optional across the client SDKs and defaults to the hosted
    endpoint (`https://cohorly-service.velloalabs.com`); the server-side default
    ingestion host moved off `http://localhost:4000` too. Existing callers that
    pass `apiHost` are unaffected.
