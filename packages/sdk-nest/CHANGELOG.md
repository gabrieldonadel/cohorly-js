## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 9d06dd2: Server behavior change: the destructive `/engage` verbs `$unset` and `$delete`
  (`people.unset` / `people.delete` / `people.delete_user` / `deleteUser`) are no
  longer honored when a request is authenticated only by the project token, which
  ships in public client bundles. They now require an org-owner or superadmin
  `Authorization: Bearer` credential on the same request. Refused ops are skipped
  individually - the rest of the batch still applies - and the server keeps
  answering HTTP 200 with `{ status: 0, error, applied, refused: [{ index, op }] }`,
  so SDK retry queues are not wedged. From these SDKs (which send only the project
  token) the destructive calls become server-side no-ops; remove profile data from
  the dashboard or via `DELETE /api/privacy/subjects/:distinctId` (audited).
  `set` / `set_once` / `increment` ($add) are unaffected. No SDK code changed;
  docs and type annotations updated.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 219627e: Reposition the SDKs as hosted SaaS instead of a local self-hosted project, and
  make the ingestion host zero-config.

  - Descriptions, README intros, and examples now describe Cohorly as hosted
    product analytics.
  - `apiHost` is now optional across the client SDKs and defaults to the hosted
    endpoint (`https://cohorly-service.velloalabs.com`); the server-side default
    ingestion host moved off `http://localhost:4000` too. Existing callers that
    pass `apiHost` are unaffected.

- Updated dependencies [219627e]
  - @cohorly/node@0.2.0
